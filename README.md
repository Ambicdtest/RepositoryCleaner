Tool to easily clean repositories on a large scale. When you are developing on a lot of repositories, your computer might run out of disk space very easily. One can solve this by either providing more disk space (for example, expanding a virtual disk), but after expanding a disk twice with 10 GB, this tool was created.

As the image below shows, a test with 130 repositories resulted into **30 GB of saved disk space**. This means that an average repository takes about 200 MB of space which might not be needed all the time.

# How to use

The usage is extremely simple. Just point to the right directory and hit *Analyze*. Analyzing can take a while, depending on the number of repositories.

## Checking the details of a repository

To check out the details of a repository (to see what takes the most space), hover the size to check how much space each implemented cleaner can clean up.

## Cleaning up the repositories

There are 2 ways to clean up a repository. The fake clean up allows one to test / check what will go on during a clean. This mode will not actually delete any files.
